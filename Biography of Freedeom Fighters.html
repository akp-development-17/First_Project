    <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <div id="first" <p>Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar,
        India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the
        leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the
        father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to
        achieve political and social progress.In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma
        (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his
        tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the
        Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only
        increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.Gandhi
        was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief
        minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat state)
        under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able
        administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes, their long-suffering subjects, and
        the headstrong British political officers in power.</p>

    <h1>Subash Chandra Bose</h1>
    <div id="second">
        <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, byname Netaji (Hindi: “Respected Leader”), (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa
            [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?), Indian revolutionary prominent in the
            independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad
            against the Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an
            ally and at other times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence
            and for his push for socialist policies.The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at
            Presidency College, Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and
            the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the University of
            Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service
            examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his
            candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported
            financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer
            and Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.Bose joined the noncooperation
            movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who had made the Indian National Congress a powerful nonviolent
            organization. Bose was advised by Gandhi to work under Chitta Ranjan Das, a politician in Bengal. There Bose
            became a youth educator, journalist, and commandant of the Bengal Congress volunteers. His activities led to
            his imprisonment in December 1921. In 1924 he was appointed chief executive officer of the Calcutta
            Municipal Corporation, with Das as mayor. Bose was soon after deported to Burma (Myanmar) because he was
            suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements. Released in 1927, he returned to find Bengal
            Congress affairs in disarray after the death of Das, and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress.
            Shortly thereafter he and Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the Indian National
            Congress. Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of the party against the more
            compromising, right-wing Gandhian faction.</p>

    <h1>Lal Bahadur Shastri</h1>
    <div id="third">
        <p>Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri was born on October 2, 1904 at Mughalsarai, a small railway town seven miles from
            Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. His father was a school teacher who died when Lal Bahadur Shastri was only a year
            and half old. His mother, still in her twenties, took her three children to her father’s house and settled
            down there.Lal Bahadur’s small town schooling was not remarkable in any way but he had a happy enough
            childhood despite the poverty that dogged him.He was sent to live with an uncle in Varanasi so that he could
            go to high school. Nanhe, or ‘little one’ as he was called at home, walked many miles to school without
            shoes, even when the streets burned in the summer’s heat.As he grew up, Lal Bahadur Shastri became more and
            more interested in the country’s struggle for freedom from foreign yoke. He was greatly impressed by Mahatma
            Gandhi’s denunciation of Indian Princes for their support of British rule in India. Lal Bahadur Sashtri was
            only eleven at the time, but the process that was end day to catapult him to the national stage had already
            begun in his mind.Lal Bahadur Shastri was sixteen when Gandhiji called upon his countrymen to join the
            Non-Cooperation Movement. He decided at once to give up his studies in response to the Mahatma’s call. The
            decision shattered his mother’s hopes. The family could not dissuade him from what they thought was a
            disastrous course of action. But Lal Bahadur had made up his mind. All those who were close to him knew that
            he would never change his mind once it was made up, for behind his soft exterior was the firmness of a
            rock.Lal Bahadur Shastri joined the Kashi Vidya Peeth in Varanasi, one of the many national institutions set
            up in defiance of the British rule. There, he came under the influence of the greatest intellectuals, and
            nationalists of the country. ‘Shastri’ was the bachelor’s degree awarded to him by the Vidya Peeth but has
            stuck in the minds of the people as part of his name.In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi marched to the sea beach at
            Dandi and broke the imperial salt law. The symbolic gesture set the whole country ablaze. Lal Bahadur
            Shastri threw himself into the struggle for freedom with feverish energy. He led many defiant campaigns and
            spent a total of seven years in British jails. It was in the fire of this struggle that his steel was
            tempered and he grew into maturity.</p>

    <h1>Jawaharlal Nehru</h1>
    <div id="fourth">
        <p>Jawaharlal Nehru, byname Pandit (Hindi: “Pundit” or “Teacher”) Nehru, (born November 14, 1889, Allahabad,
            India—died May 27, 1964, New Delhi), first prime minister of independent India (1947–64), who established
            parliamentary government and became noted for his neutralist (nonaligned) policies in foreign affairs. He
            was also one of the principal leaders of India’s independence movement in the 1930s and ’40s.Nehru was born
            to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative aptitude and scholarship, who had migrated
            to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a son of Motilal Nehru, a renowned lawyer and leader of the
            Indian independence movement, who became one of Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s prominent associates. Jawaharlal
            was the eldest of four children, two of whom were girls. A sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, later became the
            first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly.Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home
            by a series of English governesses and tutors. Only one of those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist,
            Ferdinand Brooks—appears to have made any impression on him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor
            who taught him Hindi and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to Harrow, a leading English school, where he stayed for
            two years. Nehru’s academic career was in no way outstanding. From Harrow he went to Trinity College,
            Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an honours degree in natural science. On leaving Cambridge he
            qualified as a barrister after two years at the Inner Temple, London, where in his own words he passed his
            examinations “with neither glory nor ignominy.The seven years Nehru spent in England left him in a hazy
            half-world, at home neither in England nor in India. Some years later he wrote, “I have become a queer
            mixture of East and West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.” He went back to India to discover
            India. The contending pulls and pressures that his experience abroad were to exert on his personality were
            never completely resolved.</p>

    <h1>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h1>
    <div id="fifth">
        <p>Vallabhbhai Patel, in full Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, byname Sardar Patel (Hindi: “Leader Patel”), (born
            October 31, 1875, Nadiad, Gujarat, India—died December 15, 1950, Bombay [now Mumbai]), Indian barrister and
            statesman, one of the leaders of the Indian National Congress during the struggle for Indian independence.
            During the first three years of Indian independence after 1947, he served as deputy prime minister, minister
            of home affairs, minister of information, and minister of states.Patel was born into a self-sufficient
            landowning family of the Leva Patidar caste. Reared in an atmosphere of traditional Hinduism, he attended
            primary school at Karamasad and high school at Petlad but was mainly self-taught. Patel married at the age
            of 16, matriculated at 22, and passed the district pleader’s examination, which enabled him to practice law.
            In 1900 he set up an independent office of district pleader in Godhra, and two years later he moved to
            Borsad.As a lawyer, Patel distinguished himself in presenting an unassailable case in a precise manner and
            in challenging police witnesses and British judges. In 1908 Patel lost his wife, who had borne him a son and
            daughter, and thereafter remained a widower. Determined to enhance his career in the legal profession, Patel
            traveled to London in August 1910 to study at the Middle Temple. There he studied diligently and passed the
            final examinations with high honours.Returning to India in February 1913, he settled in Ahmadabad, rising
            rapidly to become the leading barrister in criminal law at the Ahmadabad bar. Reserved and courteous, he was
            noted for his superior mannerisms, his smart, English-style clothes, and his championship in bridge at
            Ahmadabad’s fashionable Gujarat Club. He was, until 1917, indifferent to Indian political activities.In 1917
            Patel found the course of his life changed after having been influenced by Mohandas K. Gandhi. Patel adhered
            to Gandhi’s satyagraha (policy of nonviolence) insofar as it furthered the Indian struggle against the
            British. But he did not identify himself with Gandhi’s moral convictions and ideals, and he regarded
            Gandhi’s emphasis on their universal application as irrelevant to India’s immediate political, economic, and
            social problems. Nevertheless, having resolved to follow and support Gandhi, Patel changed his style and
            appearance. He quit the Gujarat Club, dressed in the white cloth of the Indian peasant, and ate in the
            Indian manner.</p>
